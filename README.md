# Overview

After looking at the data concerning unicorn start ups and their growing prevelance in Utah, I decided to create a data analysis of unicorns throughout the world and the US to put the growth of the Utah unicorn scene in perspective.

I obtained the data set from Kaggle with the link provided before. Although the data required some cleaning, the project was fairly good to use from the get-go.

I hope to find the similarities and disparities of what makes start-ups succeed and feel that the following illustrations showcase the direction the Utah start up scene is headed in relation to the rest of the nation and world.

# Data Analysis Results

The main questions I have tried to answer with the two graphs created were:

1. What are the amount of unicorns in each country?
2. And how do utah companies compare in growth to other U.S unicorn start ups?

The results are honestly astounding. There is more unicorn companies in my city than there are in 75% of the worlds countries. The U.S is far (almost triple) surpassed the next best country in terms of current unicorn companies.

# Development Environment

For this project the following tools were used:
* Kaggle for data
* Pandas and Python for data analysis
* Altair charting for illustrations
* VS Code for my IDE with Jupiter Notebooks to help.

# Future Work

A few things I will do in the future to improve this project
* Showcase how Utah companies compare in VC's and if who the investors are contribute to the long term success of the company.
* Run a machine learning model on the data to determine if we can predict how a new start up might succeed.
* Create a web app showcasing the insights listed above.
